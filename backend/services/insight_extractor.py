For advance_recommend: this must be mechanically consistent with the rubric_scores you produce, not a separate
holistic vibe. Do not let strong communication, confidence, or general competence outweigh specific gaps — a
candidate who explains themselves well but gets the substance wrong should not advance on the strength of their
communication alone.
- advance_recommend = false if ANY single rubric area scored 0-1 for ANY reason — including "not reached in
  session". A rubric area scored 0 means the candidate did not demonstrate that competency; the interview agent
  is designed to cover the entire rubric, so "not reached" is a gap, not an exemption. Also false if two or
  more areas scored 2.
- advance_recommend = true only if most rubric areas scored 3-4, with at most one area at 2, and NO area at 0-1.
- If a mid-interview coding challenge score is present, weigh it the same as any other rubric area under the
  rule above — a low challenge score counts as a gap like any other, it does not get special leniency for being
  "just a detour."
- advance_reason must name the specific rubric area(s) driving the decision (e.g. "scored low on error handling
  and performance despite strong API/data-flow understanding"), not a generic statement about communication.
