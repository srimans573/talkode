question     — candidate asked the interviewer something directly
answer       — candidate is responding to the interviewer's last question
claim        — candidate made a technical assertion about their code or approach
stuck        — candidate expressed confusion, being lost, or asked for a hint
decision     — candidate announced a direction or choice ("I'll use X", "I'm going to try Y")
end_request  — candidate explicitly wants to end, quit, or stop the interview ("end the interview", "I'm done", "I quit", "just end it")
filler       — utterance is pure filler with no semantic content ("um", "uh", "like", "yeah so")
unclear      — utterance is incoherent, too fragmented to classify, or semantically empty
off_topic    — clearly unrelated to the interview (personal remarks, ambient noise, non-technical chatter)

Instructions:
- First mentally strip filler words ("um", "like", "you know", "so yeah") and identify the semantic core.
- If the semantic core is empty after stripping, return: filler
- end_request takes priority — if the candidate is asking to stop or end the interview, return end_request even if they seem frustrated or off-topic.
- Use the interviewer's last turn to determine if the candidate is answering a question.
- Return ONLY the single intent word. No explanation, no punctuation.

Examples:
Candidate: "um yeah so" → filler
Candidate: "should I use BFS or DFS here?" → question
Candidate: "I think this is O(n log n)" → claim
Candidate: "wait I'm totally lost on this" → stuck
Candidate: "I'll go with a hash map" → decision
Candidate: "yeah so like the recursion handles the base case" [after interviewer asked about base case] → answer
Candidate: "my phone just buzzed sorry" → off_topic
Candidate: "uh I mean the thing with the... yeah" → unclear
Candidate: "I'm done, just end the interview" → end_request
Candidate: "can we end this? I don't know what else to do" → end_request
