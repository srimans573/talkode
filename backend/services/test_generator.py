    return f"""You are generating a self-contained test runner for a coding problem.
The test runner will be APPENDED to the candidate's solution code, compiled/interpreted as a single file,
and must output a JSON array to stdout.

Language: {language}
Language-specific notes: {lang_note}

Problem title: {problem.get("title")}
Problem description:
{problem.get("description", "")}

Examples (EXACT expected outputs — you MUST use these; never invent expected values for visible tests):
{examples_text or "(no examples provided)"}

Constraints:
{constraints_text or "(none)"}

Starter code (shows the function/method signature you must call):
{starter or "(not provided — infer from description)"}

---

TASK: Write ONLY the test runner code (no markdown, no fences, no explanation).

The runner must:
1. Include EXACTLY 2-3 visible tests (marked visible=true). Use ONLY the first 2-3 examples — do NOT make visible tests from every example even if there are more. Visible tests are shown to the candidate.
2. Include EXACTLY 3-4 hidden tests (marked visible=false). REQUIRED — never skip these. They cover edge cases: empty inputs, single element, all same values, large N, boundary values. These are NOT shown to the candidate.
3. Each test call must be wrapped in try/except (or try/catch) so one failure does not abort all tests.
4. Output a single JSON array to stdout. Each element must have: desc (string), visible (bool), passed (bool), actual (any), expected (any). Optionally: error (string).
   The desc must describe the actual input, e.g. "Example 1: nums=[2,7], target=9" or "Edge: empty string". NEVER use generic names like "Visible Test 1", "Hidden Test 2", "Test Case 3", etc.
5. For order-independent results (like indices), sort before comparing.
6. CRITICAL — DO NOT include any import/include/using/require statements in the harness. Standard library imports are already prepended before the candidate's code by the test runner. Adding imports again will cause compile errors (Java: "class expected", C++: duplicate headers, etc.).
7. CRITICAL: The entire harness must exit with code 0 no matter what.
   - For Python: wrap the final `print` in its own try/except; use `default=str` in json.dumps.
   - For Java/C++/C#: wrap ALL test calls in one outer try/catch and print whatever you have so far on error. Keep the catch block to 1 simple line — never put a long JSON string literal in a catch clause (it will break if truncated).
   - The fallback output should be SHORT: e.g. `System.out.println("[]");` or `cout << "[]";` — not a full JSON error object.
8. Keep the harness as concise as possible. Avoid long helper comments or repeated boilerplate. Every token counts.
9. CRITICAL: Keep the entire harness under 65 lines total. Truncated harnesses cause compile errors.

Here is a complete Python example for Two Sum to illustrate the required output format and structure:

Now write the equivalent runner for the problem above in {language}. Output ONLY the code — no prose, no fences."""
