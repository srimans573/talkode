       performance concerns), not just a generic "efficiency" framing?
    2. Completeness — is the description/examples/constraints intact, or did
       the scrape lose something (a dangling "...following interface:" etc.)?

    If it's relevant but only has a small, mechanical gap (e.g. a missing
    interface list that the starter code already implies), the model is
    allowed to patch ONLY the description text and we use its fixed version —
    examples/constraints/starter code are never touched. If it's irrelevant,
    or broken beyond a small fix, it's rejected and the caller moves on to
    the next candidate in the pool.

Candidate's actual codebase / assessment context:
{codebase_context or "(no codebase context available)"}

Candidate question being considered:

Difficulty: {problem.get("difficulty")}
Topics: {", ".join(problem.get("topics") or [])}

Description:
{problem.get("description", "")}

Examples:
{examples_text or "(none)"}

Constraints:
{constraints_text or "(none)"}

Starter code:
{problem.get("starter_code", {}).get(problem.get("default_language", "python"), "")}

Evaluate two things:

1. RELEVANCE: does this question touch on a concept, data structure, or performance concern that plausibly
   relates to the codebase context above (e.g. the codebase does lookups and this is about hash maps; the
   codebase streams data and this is about sliding windows/queues; etc.)? It doesn't need to be a perfect match —
   just a genuine, explainable connection a candidate would find sensible, not a forced stretch.

2. COMPLETENESS: this dataset is scraped from web pages. Common defects:
   a) A sentence ending in a colon that promises something ("the following interface:", "for example:") and then
      the text just moves on without delivering it.
   b) The description field contains ONLY example data ("Example 1: Input: ... Output: ...") with no actual
      problem statement explaining what the candidate is supposed to implement. If a candidate read only the
      description they would not know what to do — this is broken.
   c) The description is missing critical information (input format, output format, what to return) such that
      the problem cannot be solved from the description alone.

   Decide:
   - "fixable": the gap is small and mechanical (e.g. you can tell exactly what list/example should follow from
     the starter code or examples) — in this case, write a corrected description that fills ONLY that gap. Do
     not rewrite, rephrase, or improve anything else about the description.
   - "broken": the gap is more than a small mechanical fix, the description is essentially just examples with no
     problem statement, or the question is confusing/ambiguous/missing information needed to solve it.

3. FRAMING: if the problem is relevant, write one sentence (≤20 words) that a human interviewer would say
   to bridge from the candidate's codebase to this problem. Reference something concrete from the codebase
   context — a specific file, component, or behaviour the candidate just discussed. Do NOT say "our session
   store" or anything generic. Example: "Your fetchEmployees function does a lot of repeated lookups —
   let's try a data structure problem that keeps those fast."
